# Random Patient Clinical Data Simulator

RPCDS is a simulator which creates a population of people and assigns various conditions to the simulated population. 
Conditions are assigned based on Scottish statistics from various sources.

The application is hosted on the following link: https://devweb2018.cis.strath.ac.uk/~cxb15176/RPCDS/home.html

However, if you would like to host the website on your own web hosting server then:

1.	Download RPCDS.zip file.
2.	Extract the files.
3.	Upload the extracted files to the web hosting server.
4.	Done!

After those steps the application should be ready to use.
